  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello ruby friends! It&#8217;s time for us to get together again. We just realized it has been a year since our first ruby meetup, and we think its time to <strong>celebrate</strong>!</p>

<p>For meetup #8, we are having a <strong>pizza party</strong>! Come on, invite anyone who might be interested in ruby or web-development. We&#8217;ll have pizza and some beer. If you can bring a few drinks or other snaks, that will make the party better.</p>

<p>Rather than spend all our time talking about code, lets have some fun time with our community; get to know each other, and have a good time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/meetup7.jpg" style="width: 800px" alt="It really is a ruby party" title="Join us every other month!" /></p>

<p>Last wednesday we had a great turnout for the 7th gzruby meetup! It was a blast with tons of great people, some nice talks, and a lot of fun. I&#8217;d say this last event was maybe more of a ruby party than a developer meeting, and that&#8217;s not a bad thing!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a year since our first event, and already we&#8217;ve seen several projects started by members of our group referring clients to one another, or working together on a big project. We started this event to enable this kind of cooperation, and we couldn&#8217;t be happier that we have been successful. Remember, the more ruby projects get done here in South China, the more people will be interested to start new projects, and we all do better!</p>

<p>Its great to continuously meet new members, and to reconnect with the old ones. Lets spread the word and make <strong>gzruby</strong> a great place for all of us to find friends, learn from each other, and do great business together!</p>

<p><a href="http://weibo.com/strandbeer">Strand Beer</a> once again supplied us with plenty of homebrew goodness. Keep making that great beer fine ruby fellow!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Integrating Rails with Wordpress <a href="http://thenanfang.com">http://thenanfang.com</a></strong></p>

<p>Leon presented his company&#8217;s latest project (a <a href="http://gzruby.com">gzruby</a> connection): <a href="http://thenanfang.com">TheNanfang.com</a>. He described how he and his team were able to use Rails to win the project, by building a very rapid working prototype. After winning the project, they were able to execute and complete the project on time using standard Rails best practices and good old hard work. Leon and Rain also described how they were able to marry the de-facto blogging platform WordPress into their Rails site. We are all proud of their work and its an excellent addition to the group of ruby projects based here in South China. Great job <a href="http://beansmile.com">beansmile</a>!</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="http://beansmile.com">Leon Du</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introducing FriendsMap.net <a href="http://friendsmap.net">http://friendsmap.net</a></strong></p>

<p> <a href="http://www.weibo.com/n/cantin_">@cantin_</a> just released <a href="http://friendsmap.net">FriendsMap.net</a>, a toy project that displays your social network friends on a map. He gave a short talk about what he used to put it together, and gave a quick demo.</p>

<p> It is a project to pratice using the OAuth2 APIs and google maps. You can now use the site to find your Facebook, Twitter, QQ, and your Sina Weibo friends. There is a China version that works with Weibo and Baidu maps, or you if available to you, you can use Google Maps to location friends around the world.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="https://github.com/cantin">Cantin Xu</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explaining Session hijacking and why we need CSRF protection <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jevgz">@jevgz</a> showed us how easy it is for an attacker to create a site that could change the user&#8217;s password just by mousing over a link. He showed us step by step what can happen if you don&#8217;t follow Rails best practices and leave your site open to attack. Its a stark reminder of how to important it is to stay on top of current security trends. It was also a great explanation on why we need the CSRF tags in our Rails projects. If you haven&#8217;t read the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">Rails security guide</a>, I suggest you do so soon.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="https://github.com/jevgz">@jevgz</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Textilize <a href="http://github.com/kudelabs/textilize/">http://github.com/kudelabs/textilize/</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.weibo.com/ifosen">@ifosen</a> recently released a new gem that provides the Rails 2.x textilize helper methods in Rails 3.x. In case you are updating an older app that relied on these functions, you can simply drop this gem into your Gemfile and you&#8217;re ready to go. There are other gems that already do this, but these gems utilize the latest version of Redcloth, which is (in our opinion) unneccessarily large and complicated, requiring native extensions to be compiled. Textilize avoids this extra dependency by including the original RedCloth.rb written by _why.</p>

<p>@adevadeh stressed the importance of anlysing your gemfile to reduce external dependencies. Make sure that everything you rely on in something you really need. Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to publish a gem, even if its a small one. You never know who else might find it useful, and you may get something back you never expected!</p>

<p>I think we can all agree that the meeting held May 16, 2012 was one of our best yet. We had a bunch of new visitors. Its thrilling to see young rubyists joining our ranks, and at this meeting we had 5 recent graduates who all learned ruby on their own. We also love to see visitors from other platforms, we welcome anyone who has a passion for technology and software development.</p>

<p>At this meeting we had the honor of hosting guests from China Telecom. They were looking to find the next great mobile app and learn about what current mobile app developers are thinking about. Visitors of all types are welcome - from different disciplines and different platforms. Developers don&#8217;t work in a vaccum, we need to work together with others to make sure our products get out into the world.</p>

<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://weibo.com/strandbeer">Strand Beer</a> for the wonderful refreshment!</p>

<li><p><strong>Namespace-less Rails Engines <a href="http://github.com/shaokun/nl-engine/">http://github.com/shaokun/nl-engine/</a></strong></p>

<p>As we develop more and more applications, we find ways to make our life easier and start to re-use parts of an app in the next project. Hopefully, as time goes on, we can build reusable components that we can use in future apps to speed up development. In static, client side developemnt, this kind of code reuse is common and easily accomplished. In web development, when dealing with server side code, HTML, javascript and databases, it can get complicated. As of Rails 3.x Engines are very handy and a great way to share code between apps. But you don&#8217;t want exactly the same code in every project. Sometimes one client wants to be able to delete widgets, another client wants to edit widgets, and a third client wants to be able to copy her widgets. So the next question is, how do we share common code between apps, and use ruby&#8217;s object oriented nature to extend functionality.</p>

<p>In his talk, Shaokun described a technique to make sharing code easier by building Rails Engines that can be overridden cleanly. The engine code is kept seperate and any custom functionality is implemented at the project level. Your engine can live in a git submodule, and all of your custom code - model, controller, and views - lives in your current project. This separation makes it easy to continue to maintain the core functionality while being able to satisfy each client&#8217;s needs.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="https://github.com/shaokun">伍少坤</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Angular.js <a href="http://angularjs.org/">http://angularjs.org/</a> (<a href="http://igorminar.github.com/ng-slides/angular-intro/index.html">slides</a>)</strong></p>

<p>Rails is a great framework for the server side. It gives you a well-defined structure and lots of tools for managing data and code on the server. Yet modern web apps have matured to the point where much of the interesting parts of the app are on the client side. On this side Rails shows some weakness - you need to mix several languages, js, css, html, erb into templates that are compiled server-side and then sent to the browser fully-baked. In today&#8217;s world of highly interactive and dynamic web applications, the Rails way is simply no longer good enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js">Angular.js</a> is one of many projects attempting to fill in this gap. It is a way to manage client side view logic compltely in the browser using pure HTML and JS. Similar to projects like <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a>, it allows you to define html templates and fill them with live data, either taken from a server or computed in the browser with user input.</p>

<p>Angular caught our attention because it integrates well with existing technologies, it doesn&#8217;t require you to move everything over at once. You can implement just part of a page in angular, if you wish, and change the rest slowly over time. It also has a very clean way of dealing with data from the server and integrating it into the page.</p>

<p>Paired with a strong server-side framework like <a href="https://github.com/IgorMinar/angularjs_rails_demo">Rails, Angular</a> could be the the missing piece. The piece that takes us into a new world of truly interactive, user friendly, web apps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="images/meetup5.jpg" style="width: 800px" alt="Happy group members" title="Join us every other month!" /></p>

<p>OK, this is a bit late. The last gzruby meeting we held, on March 21, was a great success: we had visitors from Shenzhen and a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danielkehoe">Rails hero from the US</a>; we imbibed some <a href="http://www.weibo.com/strandbeer">great beer made by one of our members</a>; and to top it all off we had some really fun and exciting presentations.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Working with Bootstrap <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a></strong></p>

<p>With Rails, we have a very stable and mature back-end framework that allows us to write code in a standard way. Bootstrap from Twitter provides a similar functionality for the front-end. Rather than rolling your own css again and again, bootstrap gives you a standard way to layout your HTML pages, a standard way to style buttons and other elements, and it is generally much better than anything you could come up with on your own.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="https://github.com/leondu">Leon Du</a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/leondu/twitter-bootstrap-12949509">slides</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introducing Web-App-Themes <a href="https://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme">https://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme</a></strong></p></li>
</ul>


<p> When starting a new app, we have to choose how to style it. We want it to look nice, but don&#8217;t want to spend time designing colors or write out tons of markup. Web App Themes takes care of this for us. But rather than an engine or an almost ready made app, it simply helps you generate HTML and CSS for you to use as you see fit. For certain projects where you just need to get started with some reasonable good looking HTML and CSS, Web App Themes may be your best option.</p>

<p>  Presented by <a href="https://github.com/shaokun">@shaokun</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Wonders of Pry <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry">https://github.com/pry/pry</a></strong></p>

<p>Pry is an IRB replacement that will knock your socks off. William certianly knocked our socks off with his presentation! Imagine being able to treat your entire ruby process&#8217; object space like a simple filesystem, where you can travel down paths to inspect data, <code>cd ..</code> to go back, and search down another branch. You can even ask questions like &#8220;Which method on (this object) could give me (this result)?&#8221; If you are a ruby developer and haven&#8217;t seen pry, you need to give it a look.</p>

<p>To invoke pry in your rails app, just add the line: <code>(require pry; binding.pry) #!!</code></p>

<p>Presented by William</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rails App Templates <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/">http://railsapps.github.com/</a></strong></p>

<p>The Rails ecosystem is full of choices, you&#8217;ve got gems and engines, fixture generators and testing frameworks. This can get overwhelming as technologies change fast. That&#8217;s where this project comes in. It attempts to provide up-to-date documentation on the latest best-practices with Rails. Whether its building apps that use Devise for authentication, or how to integrate bootstrap into Rails, Rails Apps has you covered. Check out their extensive list of template apps and detailed tutorials.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ruby开发者们，我们又来了！咱们小聚一下，分享过去这几个月我们在Ruby领域上面所关注的，学习的。瞧瞧，<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store/">Rails 3.2</a>发布了，还有<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/02/16/ruby-1-9-3-p125-is-released/">ruby 1.9.3-p125</a> 和 <a href="http://spreecommerce.com/blog/2012/02/09/spree-1-0-0-released/">Spree 1.0</a>，在这里有许多很酷的东西值得我们去分享和讨论的。你还可以谈谈你在github上面有趣的项目，或者一些新颖的工具，或者一个帮助我们更快地coding的小技巧，我们都希望你能跟咱们分享！</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Wednesday, Jan 11th we held our fourth meetup. Again, we had a wonderful time getting to know fellow rubyists. There were quite a few new faces, including <a href="http://haifengsoft.com">visitors from Denmark</a>, and new <a href="http://favoritemedium.com">members from Singapore</a>. We love to meet new people, so if you have friends or know anyone who may be interested, please bring them along next time.</p>

<p>As is our custom, we started the meeting with general introductions, then went into our talks for the evening. Here are some notes on the topics presented:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Introducing <a href="http://www.gzruby.org">http://www.gzruby.org</a></strong></p>

<p>The official blog for gzruby. We plan to use the blog to record our meetings and as a landing page for Ruby and Rails in South China. As our organization grows, we hope people continue to find the blog and that makes it easier for them to find the group and come to a meeting. This is the site for our community, so please make suggestions or contribute directly. The source is on <a href="http://github.com/gzruby/gzruby.github.com">github</a>.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="http://github.com/adevadeh">@adevadeh</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zero-config local servers - pow <a href="http://pow.cx">http://pow.cx</a></strong></p>

<p>This is a great way for developers and testers to run apps locally. Why not use <code>rails server</code> you may ask? Because rather than starting and stopping your app all the time, your <code>pow</code> server will just keep your app running. You don&#8217;t need to fuss about with ports, so it&#8217;s easy to run multiple apps at the same time. If you are working with any oauth APIs such as the Facebook API, you need a real domain name for your test app; <code>pow</code> gives you a really easy way to set that up. Don&#8217;t forget, you should also check out the <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_4"><code>pow</code> helper gems</a> to make things even easier.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="http://twitter.com/teohm">HuiMing</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Joys of seed-fu <a href="https://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu">https://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu</a></strong></p>

<p>Making sure your Rails app has the right data to start things off can get really cumbersome. seed-fu helps make the process a little more streamlined and friendly. You can easily specify objects that need to be created and stored in your DB every time you start your app.</p>

<p>Presented by <a href="http://weibo.com/huipingc">Kevin</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Future of Personal Robotics <a href="assets/EmergingParadigms_Robotics.pdf">(slides)</a></strong></p>

<p>A very interesting talk indeed. We looked at where cheap robots are today, and what we could do to take them to the next level. We already have cheap robots that can move on their own, react to humans, and perform basic tasks. To expand the abilities of these robots, we could make the brain on the robot more sophisticated and expensive. But why not move the brain to the smartphone? This way we can add complex behaviors that interact with humans and the cloud. Robots from <a href="http://arexx.com.cn">http://arexx.com.cn</a> were demonstrated. Who knows, maybe soon we&#8217;ll have a <code>my_robot</code> gem that allows you to write apps to control a domestic helper robot.</p>

</ul>


<hr />

<p>Thanks very much to our presenters for sharing. We would like to encourage anyone to present at the next meeting. You can talk about anything you find interesting, or something you find useful in your work. By sharing with each other, we learn from each other, and we all become better developers.</p>
