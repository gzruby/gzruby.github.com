Hello ruby friends! It's time for us to get together again. We just realized it has been a year since our first ruby meetup, and we think its time to **celebrate**!

For meetup #8, we are having a **pizza party**! Come on, invite anyone who might be interested in ruby or web-development. We'll have pizza and some beer. If you can bring a few drinks or other snaks, that will make the party better.

Rather than spend all our time talking about code, lets have some fun time with our community; get to know each other, and have a good time!

#### 时间/When: September 19, 7:00 PM
#### 地点/Where: [Kudelabs 明月一路59号, 汉苑 西塔601](http://gz.o.cn/13105)
#### 地铁/Metro: [五羊村A出口/Line 5 - Wu Yang Cun, Exit A](http://www.exploregz.com/metro/pedia/station/wuyangcun/)
