Special thanks to [Beansmile](http://beansmile.com) for sponsoring our event and [Strand Beer](http://weibo.com/strandbeer) for making wonderful drinks!

* **[Rails 4 Overview](http://gu-da.com/articles/1)**
   
  _JAS presented his very good writeup about the new features in Rails 4, about which we should start learning. I'm excited about built-in queues, but it seems like that's been removed for now. In any case, Rails 4 should be a great update that we are all looking forward to. This Chinese writeup is a great example of how we can contribute to the community and share our knowledge.

* **Introducing FriendsMap.net <http://friendsmap.net>**
   
   [@cantin_](http://www.weibo.com/n/cantin_) just released [FriendsMap.net](http://friendsmap.net), a toy project that displays your social network friends on a map. He gave a short talk about what he used to put it together, and gave a quick demo. 
   
   It is a project to pratice using the OAuth2 APIs and google maps. You can now use the site to find your Facebook, Twitter, QQ, and your Sina Weibo friends. There is a China version that works with Weibo and Baidu maps, or you if available to you, you can use Google Maps to location friends around the world.
