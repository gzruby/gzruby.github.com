Ruby comrades! It is time to again unite, to share our secrets, and to push forth into the cold, cruel world of web development. This month's gzruby meetup will be held next **Wednesday, May 15th** at the Kudelabs offices, starting at 7:30.

各位，两个月过去了，是时候再次聚会了！本月的gzruby meetup将会在**2013年5月15号**（下个星期三）7点半在酷德实验室准时举行。

Since the last time we met, [Rails 4.0 RC1 is out](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/5/1/Rails-4-0-release-candidate-1/)! Has anyone started using it yet? How are we doing on [Ruby 2.0](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/3/6/matz_highlights_ruby_2_0_at_waza)? And wow, we haven't had a [security update](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/5/1/Rails-4-0-release-candidate-1/) in 2 months, that's good news.

At this meetup, lets talk **Deployment**! We've all been there - VPS accounts, Cloud Hosting, App Engines. What's working for you guys? What's the best rails host in China? Cap or Vlad? Bring us your ideas, your ninja methods, your sysadmin hacks - its time to share and learn from each other! 

#### 时间/When: 星期三－3月20号 19:30 / March 20, 7:30 PM
#### 地点/Where: [Kudelabs 明月一路59号, 汉苑 西塔601](http://gz.o.cn/13105)
####[59 Ming Yue Yi Lu, Han Yuan West Tower, Apt. 601](http://gz.o.cn/13105)
