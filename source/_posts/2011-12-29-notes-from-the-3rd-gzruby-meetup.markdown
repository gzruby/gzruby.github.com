非常感谢大家抽空过来参加昨晚的**gzruby**聚会。不仅可以跟使用ruby的老友记们交流，而且也是一次认识新朋友的好机会。很高兴看到使用**ruby**的朋友越来越多，并且可以相互分享当中的快乐<br />
Thanks to everyone who attended the **gzruby** meetup last wednesday night. It was great to get a chance to meet up with our ruby friends and we also met a lot of new people. It‘s exciting to see how the community is growing as we gain new members and introduce more people to the joys of ruby.

 以下是大家的一些分享 / The presentations included:

* Launch of **<http://gems.gzruby.org>**, the GZRUBY rubygems mirror 
* **Real Life Rails Scaling**, by [Seb](http://cn.linkedin.com/in/sebastianroth). Scaling your app, your team, and yourself. ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/SebastianRoth/rails-scaling))
* **method_proxy** - some fun with ruby's dynamic programming, by [Jev](http://github.com/jevgz). A look at how we can utilize ruby's meta-programming features to get deep insight into our code.
