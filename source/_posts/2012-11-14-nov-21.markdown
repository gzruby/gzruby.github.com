Hello ruby warriors! Time flies when you are having fun, doesn't it? After our especially excellent social event in September, its time now to get back to code and have a great tech talk.

In the ruby world, quite a few things have come up recently, and more is around the corner. [Ruby 1.9.3-p327 is out](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/11/09/ruby-1-9-3-p327-is-released/), [Ruby 2.0 is feature frozen](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-dev/46258), and [Rails 4.0 is coming soon](http://vimeo.com/51181496)! With all this going on in the ruby and Rails community, what have **you** been working on?

This month's event is sponsored by [Beansmile](http://beansmile.com) and [Strand Beer](http://weibo.com/strandbeer).
