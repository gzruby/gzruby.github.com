各位，是时候再次聚会了！本月的gzruby meetup将会在2013年1月16号（下个星期三）7点半在酷德实验室准时举行。记得在你的日历上标记噢。

Two moons have passed, its ruby time again! This month's gzruby meetup will be held next Wednesday, March 20th at the Kudelabs offices, starting at 7:30.

Huge news since the last meetup - **[RUBY2.0.0 was released](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/)**! As well as a [security patch to 1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/ruby-1-9-3-p392-is-released/). And on top of all of this excitement, Rails 4.0 is truly around the corner, as the [first beta was just released](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/25/Rails-4-0-beta1/)! 

So in light of all this new stuff, this month's event is going to be all about Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4! Bring your demo apps, your favorite tutorials, your best examples. Teach us something new! Show us why we need to upgrade right away - we're waiting :)
