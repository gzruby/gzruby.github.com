Yes, check your calenders! It's ruby time folks. This month's gzruby meetup will be held next Wednesday, Jan 16th at the Kudelabs offices, starting at 7:30.

We've had a bit of excitement recently, with two security updates in quick succession. First the [SQL Injection vulnerability](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/2/Rails-3-2-10--3-1-9--and-3-0-18-have-been-released/), then the [XML params vulnerability](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/). Don't forget a new ruby patchlevel just came out as well, [ruby1.9.3-p362](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/12/25/ruby-1-9-3-p362-is-released/). These should all keep us busy for the rest of the week testing and upgrading our deployed servers.

There's also been some discussion on the mailing list about how to organize these meetings and make our community better. One suggestion was to give each meeting a theme, to make it easier for people to suggest topics. This month's theme will be Asset Pipeline. How do you use it for your project? SASS, SCSS, LESS? Bootstrap, YUI? Bring your best practices, tips and tricks for us to share and learn from.
